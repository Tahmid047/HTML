	Arkham Knight features a large ensemble cast of characters from the history of Batman comics. The main character is Batman (Kevin Conroy)—a superhero trained to the peak of human physical and mental perfection and an expert in martial arts.[26][29] He is supported by his allies, Robin (Matthew Mercer),[30] Nightwing (Scott Porter),[31] Catwoman (Grey DeLisle),[14][32] Barbara Gordon (Ashley Greene)—who assists Batman covertly as the hacker Oracle[3][31]—and her father police commissioner James Gordon (Jonathan Banks).[31] Batman's loyal butler Alfred Pennyworth and Wayne Enterprises colleague Lucius Fox (Dave Fennoy)[33] provide Batman with tactical support,[14][34] and the holy warrior Azrael (Khary Payton) aims to replace Batman as Gotham's protector.
